# Convonaut: ChatGPT Archive Navigator

## Description

Convonaut is a user-friendly ChatGPT Archive Navigator designed to simplify the exploration of past conversations. Inspired by the exploratory spirit of [Space X-Chimp](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/), this open-source tool dynamically generates a navigable interface for your ChatGPT archives.


## Why This Project Exists

While the exported zip archive from ChatGPT provides a ready-to-use web page for viewing past conversations, it lacks user-friendly navigation and the flexibility to easily browse through multiple chats. Convonaut was created to address these limitations and provide a more enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rendering**: Utilizes JavaScript to generate the chat interface dynamically from a JSON file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clear and easy-to-navigate design, featuring a sidebar for quick chat selection and a main content area for detailed viewing.
- **Open-Source**: Feel free to contribute to the project and help make it better for everyone.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/convonaut.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the web page is loaded, you'll see a sidebar on the left with a list of chat titles. Clicking on a title will load the corresponding chat content in the main viewing area on the right.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for layout.
- `styles.css`: Styling for the HTML components.
- `script.js`: JavaScript code for dynamic rendering.
- `conversations.json`: JSON file containing the chat data.
